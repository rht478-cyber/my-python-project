# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

Welcome to `my-python-project`! This project is a simple Python codebase, currently with minimal structure and content. Please follow these guidelines to be productive as an AI coding agent:

## Project Overview
- This is a beginner-level Python project. The main file is `hellow.py`.
- There are no complex architectures, frameworks, or external dependencies at this time.
- The project is intended for learning and experimentation.

## Key Files
- `hellow.py`: Main Python script. All logic currently resides here.
- `README.md`: Contains a brief project description and the note that the user is a complete beginner.

## Development Conventions
- Use clear, beginner-friendly code and comments.
- Avoid advanced Python features unless requested.
- Prefer simple, direct solutions over abstractions.
- Add inline comments explaining non-obvious code.
- If adding new files, update the `README.md` with a short description.

## Workflows
- No build or test automation is present. To run code, execute `python hellow.py` in the project root.
- No external dependencies are required or expected.

## Patterns & Practices
- Keep code readable and easy to follow for a beginner.
- If introducing new concepts, explain them in comments or the `README.md`.
- Do not assume the presence of virtual environments or package managers.

## Example: Adding a Function
```python
# In hellow.py

def greet(name):
    """Return a friendly greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("world"))
```
